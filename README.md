# Reset-Chrome
Just a simple script to reset Chrome, this was developed 3 years ago to remove an extensions that were permanently disabled by the IT department. This may or may not remove unwanted extension under Chrome folder (not including the ones that are under ProgramData folder or etc.)
# How does this work?
This tool removes a folder that contains user data. Which is "~\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome". This will reset the chrome completly.
